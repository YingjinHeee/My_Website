title: When travelling runs into ideas
---

I walked along the Rhine river in Cologne, sky-glided from Jungfrau mountain in Interlaken, explored the mysterious Fortified City at Carcassonne. I was deeply attracted by the fabulous views across different continents, while I was also touched and impressed by the friendliness and enlightenment I encountered all along the way.

It's the Argentina girl who teaches me to cook local cuisines. It's the German friend who discusses with me the B2B market potentials in Europe. It's the Irish girl who research the localization strategy of KFC with me.

I am thrilled to explore the world, bridge cultural difference and connect dots of ideas during my trip in London and at further destinations.
